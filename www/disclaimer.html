<p>This web tool allows for the input of clinical and genomic information from individual patients with Myeloproliferative Neoplasms to provide personalised predictions on patient outcome and disease progression. It is based on data and prognostic models from Grinfeld and Nangalia et al. 2018. 

The original publication can be found at <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1716614">Grinfeld et al., N Engl J Med 2018 Oct 11;379(15):1416-30</a>.<br><br> <b>This calculator is intended as an adjunct to the paper and for research purposes only. It has not been prospectively validated.</b> 


<p>To generate individual patient prognostic predictions, select the diagnosis of interest: ET, PV, MF or other (MPNu, MDS/MPN overlap, etc.).<br>
Then choose between:
Selecting a patient already used in the analysis, or inputting variables for a new patient manually, or inputting variables for a new patient by uploading a csv file.</p>
<b>Please click on the 'Calculate Risk' button to generate predictions, changes in input parameters will only reflect in the predictions following 'Calculate Risk' being clicked</b>. <br>
